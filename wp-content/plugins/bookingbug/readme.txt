= The Booking Platform For All Businesses =

No matter what your business type, [BookingBug](http://www.bookingbug.com/ "BookingBug") is the perfect tool for taking bookings, appointments and managing staff schedules online.

This plugin allows for easy and quick embedding of your BookingBug widget either in the sidebar of your WordPress site, or in a blog post using a shortcode.

BookingBug is a highly flexible and customizable booking system for use by any business. It is designed to help you attract new customers by displaying your time and availability on your own site, as well as on other online platforms such as your Facebook business page. You can embed your widget into your Wordpress site quickly and easily and the availability and booking information is always live and up to date.

If you are a web developer looking for deeper customisation, you can edit the CSS of the booking pages and forms to create a seamless and personalised user experience for your clients.

BookingBug is completely customisable to match the way your business works and can handle a broad range of business types:

* Sports & fitness - e.g. gyms, dance classes, personal trainers, clubs and teams, and sports court bookings
* Hire & rental - e.g. villas, B&B's, equipment hire, campsites, venue hire and childrens entertainers 
* Health & beauty - e.g. spa bookings, salons, dentists, alternative therapists and massage appointments
* Classes & events - e.g. cookery classes, language courses, music classes, art classes and tours
